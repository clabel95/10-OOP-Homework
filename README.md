## Description
This assignment was to create a back end application that could be used to add Employees to a list and propogate their information into a card on a website. The application first asks for the managers information then asks what type of employee the user would like to add. The options are Engineer or Intern. If Engineer is chosen then the user will be prompted to fill in the information about the Engineer just like the manager however the engineer also includes a github username. If the user choses Intern they will again input information about the intern however instead of their github username they will be prompted to input their current school. once the user has finished entering in all employees then the information that they have provided will be dynamicly populated into an html file using a premade template.
